        // 1. Please create a command-line application in an IDE of your choice
        // 2. Create a class to store a City, with an id, a name, a country and an ordered collection of Ratings (integers).
        //       The id should be unique for each city. Make sure that the values cannot be changed after creation, only additional ratings may be added.
        // 3. Create Instances of your Class from the String above [defaultSting] (the String format is fixed as is) and store them in a manner that allows access based on the id
        // 4. present 2 Ways to output the information of the Object to StdOut
        // 5. Finally, Sort the Cities based on the average rating and Print the Ranking in order starting with the highest average
